# Coffee Shop App

## Overview

The **Coffee Shop App** is a mobile application designed to provide a seamless and interactive experience for both customers and admins of a coffee shop. The app allows users to browse the menu, place orders, and manage orders through an intuitive interface. It is developed in **Kotlin**, utilizing **XML layouts** and **Jetpack Compose** for the UI and integrates a **database** for data storage. This README outlines the key features, requirements, and design principles followed in developing the app.

## Objectives

The Coffee Shop App has been developed to meet the following core objectives:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the coffee shop's operational needs and the expectations of both customers and admin users.
2. **User Interface Design**: Build an intuitive and visually appealing UI that supports seamless navigation, either through XML Layout or Jetpack Compose.
3. **Interactive Event Handling**: Implement event-handling features to ensure a responsive and user-friendly system.
4. **Adherence to Design Patterns**: Use an appropriate design pattern to ensure clarity, modularity, and maintainability, supporting future scalability.

## Key Features

### 1. User-Centric Design
- **Customer View**: Customers can view the menu, add items to the cart, and place orders.
- **Admin View**: Admins can manage the menu items, view orders, and update order status.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The app provides responsive feedback to users, enhancing interactivity and engagement.

### 2. Database Integration
- **Data Storage**: The app uses either **SQLite** for reliable and efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensures that both customer and admin users have a seamless experience with up-to-date information.

### 3. Event Handling
- **User Interaction**: Captures and responds to user actions, such as adding items to the cart, confirming orders, and editing menu items.
- **Admin Controls**: Allows the admin to handle updates to the menu and manage orders efficiently.

### 4. Design Principles & Pattern
- **Modular Codebase**: The app is structured to separate concerns and maintain a clean codebase for easier updates and scalability.
- **Adherence to Design Patterns**: A standard design pattern (MVP) is applied to promote organized code structure and enable flexibility in future modifications.

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: XML Layout and Jetpack Compose
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Design Pattern**: MVP to ensure clear separation of concerns

### Modules
- **UI Module**: Handles the design and layout of the app screens for both customers and admins.
- **Data Module**: Manages database integration, including data models, access methods, and synchronization.
- **Logic Module**: Includes business logic, event-handling procedures, and interaction flows between UI and data.

### Database Schema
- **Menu Table**: Stores menu items (item name, description, price, availability).
- **Orders Table**: Stores order details (order ID, items, customer details, order status).
- **User Table**: Stores user credentials and preferences (admin or customer).
- **Notifications Table**: Stores user and admin notifications which detail the status of an order.
## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Open Project in Android Studio**: Open the cloned repository in Android Studio.
3. **Configure Database**:
   - For SQLite, ensure the database file is correctly configured in the data module.
4. **Run the App**: Build and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

## Design and Development Principles

1. **Scalability & Modularity**: Designed with a scalable architecture to support future enhancements without major rewrites.
2. **User-Centric Focus**: Aimed at maximizing usability and providing a positive experience for both customer and admin users.
   
## Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Covers individual methods and logic to ensure code accuracy and reliability.
- **UI Testing**: Ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience across all devices.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests the integration with the database and data flow between different modules.
- **Functional & Non-Functional Testing**: Tests app performance, responsiveness, and load times under varying conditions.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notifications**: Notify customers when their orders are ready or when new menu items are available.
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Allow admins to view reports and analytics on customer orders and preferences.
3. **Loyalty Program Integration**: Offer rewards or discounts to regular customers.

## Conclusion

The Coffee Shop App has been designed to deliver a user-friendly and efficient experience for both customers and admins, adhering to high standards of software design and best practices. With a solid foundation in Kotlin and a structured, modular approach, this app is well-suited to meet current requirements and support future expansion.
